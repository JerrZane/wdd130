       <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>How I Decompress</h3>
    <p>Music in many of its forms captivates me. Experiencing and participating in wholesome and uplifting music helps me to feel close to my God and my heavenly home. It helps me spiritually and emotionally refresh and relieve anxiety and stress. It touches my heart and soul as it reminds me that I am a stranger to this earth and it gives me a glimpse of my eternal destiny. </p>
    <h3>Lessons From Music</h3>
    <p>The electricity that I feel as I experience music fosters a deep desire within me to develop a greater ability to contribute. I felt that electricity as I learned to play the five string banjo over the last two years. I have become a proficient banjo player as I have applied basic principles of goal setting and planning on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, practicing discipline and persistence in attaining those goals and plans, consistent evaluation of myself and my experiences, reviewing and identifying music theory as I interact with it, speaking with experts, and using my limited abilities to help others experience the joys of music. </p>
