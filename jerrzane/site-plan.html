        Work Experience
Team Lead at Chick-Fil-A								
I worked at Chick-Fil-A in dâ€™Iberville Mississippi from Jan. 2019 to Jun. 2020. While Employed I   Created and executed a waste reduction plan that saved our location approx. $500  per month.
I was involved in training new staff members and in total I trained over 20 team members. This job also helped me gain experience in delegating tasks to manage my own workload and the workload of our team.

Frontier Director                                                                            
I worked for the Western Los Angeles County Council of the Boy Scouts of America from  Jun. 2018 to Aug. 2018. As the Frontier Director I Supervised and coordinated the work of staff and ensured a quality experience for  our clients. I was in charge of training staff members and managing teams of ten or more people. I created opportunities for staff and clients to develop their leadership skills. I also planned work schedules, made assignments, and implemented production sequences to accomplish the goals of our organization.

Camp Staff
I worked for the Western Los Angeles County Council of the Boy Scouts of America during the summers of 2015, 2016, 2017.  As camp staff I learned to instruct and teach young men ages 10-18. I developed lesson plans including interactive learning, and gained leadership skills including public speaking, and managing 20 students at a time.

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        
Leadership from the beginning 
From my beginnings the Lord has prepared me to be a leader, it's ingrained in my character. Growing up as the oldest of eight kids, I was destined to be an example whether for good or evil. I was the only member of the Restored Church of Jesus Christ attending my High School, at times I experienced bigotry and discrimination because of my religieous beliefs and the strict observence of my standards. Living where members of the Church are a minority has given me many opportunities to solemnly stand for truth. 

Service in leadership
At a young age I developed a love for service, this in tandem with my leadership skills produced many opportunities to bless the lives of others as a leader. As a fifteen year old Eagle Scout I was asked to serve as the Senior Patrol Leader becoming the most senior leader in the troop. I spent each summer from the age of 14-17 working for the Boy Scouts of America at one of their camps. I was asked in the final year to manage a department supervising several staff members and Scouts. I later began work at Chick-fil-a and was quickly promoted to trainer and then to manager. As a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I learned to be a good follower and my leadership abilities were expanded as I found the correlation between leading and discipleship. These opportunities to lead have come as I have lived well and extended service. I didn't seek them but when there is a need for a leader, I will always answer the call.

Optimism and Perseverance
I am an analytical thinker and I live to solve problems. I have never allowed anything to convince me that I could not accomplish the impossible. When I set my mind on doing something it's as good as done.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        
How I Decompress
Music in many of its forms captivates me. Experiencing and participating in wholesome and uplifting music helps me to feel close to my God and my heavenly home. It helps me spiritually and emotionally refresh and relieve anxiety and stress. It touches my heart and soul as it reminds me that I am a stranger to this earth and it gives me a glimpse of my eternal destiny. 

Lessons From Music
The electricity that I feel as I experience music fosters a deep desire within me to develop a greater ability to contribute. I felt that electricity as I learned to play the five string banjo over the last two years. I have become a proficient banjo player as I have applied basic principles of goal setting and planning on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, practicing discipline and persistence in attaining those goals and plans, consistent evaluation of myself and my experiences, reviewing and identifying music theory as I interact with it, speaking with experts, and using my limited abilities to help others experience the joys of music.
