      <h2>Leadership</h2>
      <h3>Leadership from the beginning </h3>
      <p>From my beginnings the Lord has prepared me to be a leader, it's ingrained in my character. Growing up as the oldest of eight kids, I was destined to be an example whether for good or evil. I was the only member of the Restored Church of Jesus Christ attending my High School, at times I experienced bigotry and discrimination because of my religieous beliefs and the strict observence of my standards. Living where members of the Church are a minority has given me many opportunities to solemnly stand for truth.</p>
     
    <h3>Service in leadership</h3>
    <p>At a young age I developed a love for service, this in tandem with my leadership skills produced many opportunities to bless the lives of others as a leader. As a fifteen year old Eagle Scout I was asked to serve as the Senior Patrol Leader becoming the most senior leader in the troop. I spent each summer from the age of 14-17 working for the Boy Scouts of America at one of their camps. I was asked in the final year to manage a department supervising several staff members and Scouts. I later began work at Chick-fil-a and was quickly promoted to trainer and then to manager. As a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I learned to be a good follower and my leadership abilities were expanded as I found the correlation between leading and discipleship. These opportunities to lead have come as I have lived well and extended service. I didn't seek them but when there is a need for a leader, I will always answer the call.</p>
    <h3>Optimism and Perseverance</h3>
    <p>I am an analytical thinker and I live to solve problems. I have never allowed anything to convince me that I could not accomplish the impossible. When I set my mind on doing something it's as good as done.   </p>
